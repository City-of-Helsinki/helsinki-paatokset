# Paatokset Ahjo API

## Import api v2

Import API v2 is a re-write of the old codebase that uses Drupal nodes for all data. The new codes base uses custom Drupal entities. These custom entities use the Ahjo API ids as database primary keys, which makes it much simpler to query data. New entities are also trying to learn lessons from the old codebase and simplify language handling, URL structure, among other things.

**Import decisions from Ahjo API to Drupal.**

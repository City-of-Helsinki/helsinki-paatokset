{#
  Template for case attachments

  Variable attachments should be passed.

  Logic:
    - URL is set and attachment is public: display link normally
    - URL is not set but attachment is public:
      display title and "not published" label.
    - Attachment is not public: title is replaced by "confidential" label
      and the reason this attachment is confidential.

{% for attachment in attachments.items %}
  {% if attachment.file_url and attachment.publicity_class == 'Julkinen' %}
    <a href="{{ attachment.file_url }}">
      <div>{{ attachment.number }}{{ attachment.title }}</div>
    </a>
  {% else %}
    <div>
      {{ attachment.number }}{{ attachment.title }}
    </div>
  {% endif %}
{% endfor %}
